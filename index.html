        <section id="sectionB" class="code-container">
            <h2>B. Object Oriented Concepts of Java</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Classes and Objects:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Class:</strong> A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.
                    <br><strong>Object:</strong> An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates both data (attributes) and functionality (methods).</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Encapsulation:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class.
                    <br><strong>Access Modifiers:</strong> Java provides access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control the visibility of class members, supporting the principle of information hiding.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Inheritance:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Inheritance is a mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reusability.
                    <br><strong>Superclass and Subclass:</strong> The existing class is called the superclass, and the new class is the subclass. Subclasses can extend the functionality of the superclass.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Polymorphism:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different types.
                    <br><strong>Method Overloading:</strong> Java supports method overloading, allowing multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class.
                    <br><strong>Method Overriding:</strong> Subclasses can provide a specific implementation for a method defined in their superclass.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Abstraction:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors.
                    <br><strong>Abstract Classes and Interfaces:</strong> Java provides abstract classes and interfaces for abstraction. Abstract classes may have abstract methods, and interfaces define a contract for implementing classes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Association:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Association represents a relationship between two or more classes. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> In a university system, a Student class might be associated with a Course class.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Aggregation:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Aggregation is a special form of association where one class contains another class as a part, but the contained class can exist independently.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> A Department class may aggregate Faculty and Students classes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Composition:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the parts are wholly owned by the composite class. If the composite class is destroyed, its parts are also destroyed.
                    <br><strong>Example:</strong> A Car class composed of Engine and Wheels classes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Interfaces:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods. A class can implement one or more interfaces, ensuring that the implementing class provides concrete implementations for all interface methods.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Packages:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Packages in Java help in organizing classes into a hierarchical structure. They provide a namespace, preventing naming conflicts.
                    <br><strong>Access Control:</strong> Packages also contribute to access control by allowing the use of the public, protected, default, and private access modifiers.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Constructors and Destructors:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Constructors:</strong> Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects when they are created. They have the same name as the class.
                    <br><strong>Destructors:</strong> Java doesn't have explicit destructors. The garbage collector automatically deallocates memory when an object is no longer referenced.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Polymorphic Algorithms:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Java supports polymorphic algorithms through interfaces and abstract classes, allowing different classes to be used interchangeably in algorithms.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Understanding these object-oriented concepts is fundamental to effective Java programming. They provide a modular and structured approach to software development, facilitating code organization, reusability, and maintenance. By leveraging these concepts, developers can design robust and scalable systems in Java.</p>

            <h2>C. Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Encapsulation:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental object-oriented programming concepts, and it involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.
                    <br><strong>Data Hiding:</strong> Encapsulation provides the concept of data hiding, where the internal details of an object are hidden from the outside world. The internal representation of an object can be changed without affecting the code that uses the object.
                    <br><strong>Access Modifiers:</strong> In Java, access modifiers (public, private, protected, default) are used to control the visibility of class members. For example, declaring a variable as private ensures that it can only be accessed within the same class.
                    <br><strong>Getter and Setter Methods:</strong> Encapsulation often involves using getter and setter methods to control access to the attributes of a class. Getter methods retrieve the values, while setter methods set or modify the values.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Polymorphism:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Polymorphism is the ability of a single function, class, or operator to work in different ways based on the context. In Java, polymorphism is primarily achieved through method overloading and method overriding.
                    <br><strong>Method Overloading:</strong> This occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler determines which method to call based on the number and types of arguments.
                    <br><strong>Method Overriding:</strong> This happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows a subclass to provide a specialized version of a method.
                    <br><strong>Compile-time and Runtime Polymorphism:</strong> Method overloading is an example of compile-time polymorphism (or static polymorphism), as the decision is made by the compiler. Method overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism (or dynamic polymorphism), as the decision is made at runtime.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Inheritance:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class).
                    <br><strong>Superclass and Subclass:</strong> The superclass is the existing class, and the subclass is the new class that inherits from the superclass. The subclass can reuse the code of the superclass and extend its functionality.
                    <br><strong>Keyword 'extends':</strong> In Java, the extends keyword is used to establish an inheritance relationship. For example, class Subclass extends Superclass { ... }.
                    <br><strong>Types of Inheritance:</strong> Java supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one superclass, and multiple inheritance through interfaces, where a class can implement multiple interfaces.
                    <br><strong>Super Keyword:</strong> The super keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class. It is often used to call the superclass's methods, access its fields, or invoke its constructor.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance are foundational concepts in Java's object-oriented programming paradigm. They contribute to code organization, reusability, and flexibility, making it easier to design and maintain complex software systems. Developers leverage these concepts to create modular, extensible, and scalable Java applications.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Introduction to Java:</h3>
                    <p>Java is a high-level, versatile, and object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems. It was released in the mid-1990s and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages globally. Java is known for its platform independence, achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing Java programs to run on various devices without modification.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Dynamic Initialization of Variables:</h3>
                    <p>In Java, variables can be dynamically initialized, meaning their values can be set during runtime rather than at compile-time. This is often done through user input or by computing the initial value based on certain conditions. Here's an example in Java:</p>
                    <div class="code-container">
                        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-java" id="code2">
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DynamicInitializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
                            
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int userInput = scanner.nextInt();
                            
        // Dynamic initialization of a variable
        int dynamicVariable = userInput * 2;
                            
        System.out.println("Dynamic Variable: " + dynamicVariable);
    }
}
                        </code></pre>
                        <div class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode('code2')">Copy</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In this example, the value of dynamicVariable is determined based on user input at runtime.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Scope and Lifetime of Variables:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Scope:</strong> The scope of a variable defines where in the code it can be accessed. In Java, there are different levels of scope, including block scope, method scope, class scope, and global scope.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lifetime:</strong>  The lifetime of a variable is the duration during which the variable exists in the program's memory. Local variables have a shorter lifetime compared to instance and class variables.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Example of variable scope in Java:</p>
                    <div class="code-container">
                        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-java" id="code3">

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Method-level variable (method scope)
        int methodVariable = 5;

            <h2>F. Difference between Scope and Visibility</h2>
            <p>In Java, "scope" and "visibility" are related but distinct concepts that pertain to the accessibility and lifespan of variables within a program. Let's elaborate on each concept:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Scope:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Scope refers to the region of the program in which a variable is defined and can be accessed. It defines the portion of the code where a variable is valid and can be used.
                    <br><br><strong>Levels of Scope:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Variables declared within a block of code (e.g., inside a set of curly braces {}) have block scope. They are only accessible within that specific block.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Method/Function Scope:</strong> Variables declared within a method or function have method scope. They are accessible only within that method or function.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Class Scope (Instance and Static Variables):</strong> Instance variables have class scope and are accessible throughout the class. Static variables, which belong to the class rather than instances, also have class scope.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Global/Program Scope:</strong> Variables declared at the class level but outside of any method or block have global or program scope. They can be accessed throughout the entire class.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <div class="code-container">
                        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-java" id="code9">
public class ScopeExample {
    // Class-level variable (class scope)
    int globalVariable = 10;
                            
    public void exampleMethod() {
        // Method-level variable (method scope)
        int methodVariable = 5;
                            
        {
            // Block-level variable (block scope)  
            int blockVariable = 3;
            // Accessible: methodVariable, blockVariable
        }
                            
        // Accessible: methodVariable
    }
                            
    // Accessible: globalVariable
}

                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Visibility:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Visibility, in the context of Java, refers to the access level of a variable or method from outside its class. Java provides access modifiers (public, private, protected, and default) to control the visibility of members within a class. 
                        <br><br><strong>Access Modifiers:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Public:</strong> Members with public access modifier are visible to all classes, regardless of their package or location.</li>
                        <li><strong>Private: </strong>Members with private access modifier are visible only within the same class. They are not accessible from outside the class.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protected:</strong>Members with protected access modifier are visible within the same class, package, and subclasses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Default (Package-Private): </strong>Members with no explicit access modifier have default visibility, meaning they are accessible within the same package but not outside it.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Example: </h3>

    // Default visibility (package-private) variable
    int defaultVariable = 40;
                            
    // Getter method for privateVariable

                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In summary, scope deals with where a variable is valid and can be used within the program, while visibility deals with who can access the variable or method from outside its class. Understanding both concepts is crucial for designing well-organized and secure Java programs.</p>
